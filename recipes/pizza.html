  <h3>Description:</h3>
  <p>There are so many different specialty pizza options out there, and Buffalo Chicken Pizza just so happens to be my wife's all-time favorite! So it was pretty important for me to figure out how to make the BEST version of this at home. 

    This recipe has the best balance of tangy buffalo sauce, cool and creamy blue cheese, and even a few colorful add-ons like red onions, banana peppers, and green onions!
    
    This recipe keeps these flavors in perfect balance, it's a must-try for your next pizza night!

  <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
  <p><ul><li>1 ½ cups shredded chicken</li><li>1/3 cup buffalo sauce, plus more to drizzle on top</li><li>¼ cup blue cheese dressing, divided. Can sub Ranch.</li><li>1 lb. pizza dough, at room temp</li><li>1/2 cup pizza sauce</li><li>1 ½ cups mozzarella cheese</li><li>¼ cup red onions, thinly sliced</li><li>¼ cup banana pepper rings, patted dry</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <h3>Steps:</h3>

  </li><li>Spread the dough onto a lightly greased, 12-inch pizza pan (or stone). Poke holes in it with a fork to prevent the crust from bubbling up in the oven.</li>
